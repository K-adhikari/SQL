This repository contains the SQL codes I wrote to answer Coding Questions for different courses.
Module_1.sql, Module_2.sql, Module_3.sql, Module_4.sql, and Final_project.sql were the codes I wrote for 'SQL Basics for Data Science' Course in Coursera. The course used SQLite DBMS.
The datasets used for this course were from open source Chinook Database except for the Final Project.
