This repository contains the SQL codes I wrote to answer Coding Questions for different courses.

'Databases_and_SQL_for_Data_Science_with_Python' folder contains the codes I wrote while taking 'Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python' specialization course offered by IBM in Coursera.

'SQL_Basics_for_Data_Science' folder contains the codes I wrote while doing assignments for the 'SQL Basics for Data Science' course offered by University of California, Davis in Coursera. The course used SQLite DBMS. The datasets used for this course were from open source Chinook Database except for the Final Project.
