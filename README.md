This repository contains the SQL codes I wrote to answer Coding Questions for different courses.
SQL_Basics_for_Data_Science folder contains the codes I wrote while doing assignments for the 'SQL Basics for Data Science' Course in Coursera. The course used SQLite DBMS. The datasets used for this course were from open source Chinook Database except for the Final Project.
